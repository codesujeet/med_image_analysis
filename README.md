# # Medical Image Analysis - Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit-based web application for medical image analysis. The application provides an intuitive interface for loading, visualizing, and analyzing medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. The app also includes built-in functionalities like image segmentation, classification, and model prediction for medical imaging tasks.

## Features

- Upload medical images (e.g., DICOM, PNG, JPG)
- Visualize the medical images
- Image preprocessing and enhancement tools
- Built-in AI model for image classification or segmentation
- Display predictions with model confidence
- Interactive user interface powered by Streamlit

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codesujeet/med-image-analysis.git
cd medical-image-analysis-streamlit

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit app, and you can view it in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Upload Medical Image: Click the "Upload Image" button to upload a medical image file (JPEG, PNG, or DICOM format).
Image Preprocessing: Once the image is uploaded, you can apply various preprocessing operations (e.g., resizing, contrast enhancement, noise reduction).
Model Prediction: The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the presence of certain conditions (e.g., pneumonia, cancer, etc.) in the uploaded image.
Image Segmentation (Optional): You can apply image segmentation models to highlight areas of interest in the image.
Results: The app will display the predictions with their corresponding confidence levels.
Model
The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model for medical image classification and segmentation. You can replace the model in the code with your own trained model if needed. Supported models can include CNNs (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet), U-Net for segmentation, etc.
